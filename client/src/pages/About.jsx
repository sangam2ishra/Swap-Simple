                  Our project is dedicated to enhancing the travel🚈 experience
                  for passengers, especially groups, by offering a unique seat
                  swapping feature. It empowers travelers who find 🕵️‍♂️ themselves
                  dissatisfied with their allocated seats to seamlessly exchange
                  them with others if those seats better suit their preferences.

                  welfare, aiming to address the common inconvenience faced by
                  passengers when assigned random seats. By fostering a sense of
                  community and cooperation, we strive to contribute positively
                  to society's well-being.🤗
